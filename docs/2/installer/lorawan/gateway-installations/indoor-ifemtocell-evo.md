## Setting up the Kerlink iFemtocell Evolution
---------------------------------------

The Kerlink iFemtocell Evolution receives radio transmissions from the Microshare® IoT devices in and around your building and uses an integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare® Smart Network.
Please make sure your selected physical install location will allow for a good cellular signal and is central to the IoT devices you will use in your facility. Contact Microshare® if you have any doubts on the best place to install the gateway. Bad placement will result in poor performance of the overall system.
